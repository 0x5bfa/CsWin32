Microsoft Windows SDK Win32 API Source Generator
==================================================

This package contains a source generator to add a user-defined set of Win32 P/Invoke
methods and supporting types to a C# project.

To get started, create a "NativeMethods.txt" file in your project directory
that lists the names of Win32 APIs for which you need to have generated, one per line.

You should also install the `System.Memory` package when targeting .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Standard 2.0,
as that adds APIs that significantly improve much of the code generated by CsWin32:

```ps1
dotnet add package System.Memory
dotnet add package System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe
```

Projects targeting .NET Core 2.1+ or .NET 5+ do *not* need to add these package references,
although it is harmless to do so.

Note that while the `System.Memory` package depends on the `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe` package,
referencing the latter directly is still important to get the latest version of the APIs it provides.

Your project must allow unsafe code to support the generated code that will likely use pointers.
