Microsoft Windows SDK Win32 API Source Generator
==================================================

This package contains a source generator to add a user-defined set of Win32 P/Invoke
methods and supporting types to a C# project.

To get started, create a "NativeMethods.txt" file in your project directory
that lists the names of Win32 APIs for which you need to have generated, one per line.

You should also install the `System.Memory` package when targeting .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Standard 2.0,
as that adds APIs that significantly improve much of the code generated by CsWin32:

```ps1
dotnet add package System.Memory
```

Projects targeting .NET Core 2.1+ or .NET 5+ do *not* need to add the `System.Memory` package reference,
although it is harmless to do so.

Your project must allow unsafe code to support the generated code that will likely use pointers.
